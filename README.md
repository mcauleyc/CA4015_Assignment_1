# CA4015_Assignment_1 - Clustering

## The Iowa Gambling Task

The Iowa gambling task is a psychological task thought to simulate real-life decision making. There are 4 decks for participants to choose from. Each time they choose a deck they get either a reward, a penalty or a mixture of both. The aim is to get the most money. Two of the decks contain more penalties and two contain more rewards. It was found that most people tended to stick to the "good" decks after roughly 50 selections.

My task was to process the data from the Iowa Gambling Task and perform k-means clustering on it. I then performed clustering while preserving the privacy of each lab to see if that altered the results in any way.
